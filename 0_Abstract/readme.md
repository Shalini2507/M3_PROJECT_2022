# ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT
 
     In automobiles,Wiper is an essential component that is used to wipe out the raindrops or any unwanted material fragments 
from the windshield present in front.Practically all motorized vehicles features windshield wipers.Most of the cars have two wipers 
on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight.The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the car at the
front and rear, although not all cars have wipers on the rear side.Wiper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get 
stuck to the windshield.The wipers in vehicles have components like wiper motor,wiper blade,wiper arm and wiper link.The wiper motor
is one part of the wiper system that is useful for moving the wiper automatically. The commonly used wiper motor utilizes a magnet 
with a reduction gear.The wiper arm usually consists of a head that is used to tie the wiper arm to the wiper shaft.When the wiper
starts to turn on, the wiper motor will rotate the crank arm and this will make the connecting rods pull and push each other. 
The wiper link will make the wiper arm work in a semicircle around the pivot shaft. The linking rod or connecting rod which is
usually attached to the two wiper arms will make the two blades work simultaneously and work in parallel.When the wiper switch is 
in off position, the wiper will not function. When the wiper switch is in low-speed mode, the wiper will work at low speed. 
Accordingly, when the wiper switch is in high-speed mode, the wiper will work at a fairly high speed.The wiper parts visible from
outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots.
